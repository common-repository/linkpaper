== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this crazy thing? =

LinkPaper is a free plugin that scans your content for links and monetizes them by wrapping them in a referral site link such as VigLinks or SkimLinks.

= How does that work? =

Online retailers typically have referral programs where sites who link to their storefront can get commission from the sale. In an effort to make the life of the referrer easier, a few companies have decided to act as a middleman by wrapping their referral link to the retailer in a neat package. They then split a share of the revenue with you, the referrer. The process to create referral links, even through these vendors, is tedious. We have created a solution.

= Sounds pretty good, I have old content that I’d like to monetize, but don’t want to have to go all the way back and redo all of my links. How can you help? =

LinkPaper does the conversion to a referral link on the fly. This means that every ounce of content, from day one to today, is monetized dynamically as the user is loading the page. The process is completely seamless and really quick.

= Wait wait wait, on the fly? Does this slow down the user experience of my site? =
Of course not! We have thoroughly tested this plugin to make it as speedy as possible. In most cases, the links are monetized before page is even finished loading.

= Why should I use this plugin and not do it by hand? =

Manually setting up referral links just plain sucks. Also if you decide to change providers or forget to create a referral link, it is almost impossible. On the fly link injection allows you to change referral ids or vendors at your will. The changes will be seen instantly by your users the second you make them. You will never miss a link because all referrals are done for you by LinkPaper.

= Why would I want to change referral vendors at will? =

LinkPaper gives you the option to change them when you want. This means that you can test out different referral providers to see which one makes you the most money for your site’s content.
